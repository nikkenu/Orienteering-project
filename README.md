# Orienteering-project
## Project is done with C++ in Qt

**Program reads orienteering routes from inputfile, and stores them to map datastructure. Every orienteering mark,**
**has own structure which includes x and y coordinates, altitude at the point, name and marker. With this information we can**
**create orienteering map, tell about orienteering path details.**
  
**Example commands:**  
**MAP - Prints map, obviously :D**  
**ROUTES - Prints orienteering routes, also we can get specific information by (ROUTE <route name>)**  
**LENGHT <route name> - tells route lenght, its done with pythagora**  
**POINTS - tells all possible points and points markers**  
**RISE <Point> - Tells which is route has biggest __CONTINIOUS__ rise**  
  
**ps. I did only file : __routes.cpp__**
